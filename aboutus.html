The school is sponsored by the Africa Inland Church (A.I.C) and has adequate available space.The school covers the current curriculum, guided by the 8.4.4 system as approved by the ministry of education. It's a registered certified public school set to operate within the framework of the education policies, as guided by the Kenya Vision 2030 strategy. In 1969, then Minister of Education the late Tittus  Towwet wanted to close down the school because there only 9 students. It took the intervention of the late Salim Chepkaitany who was the school stakeholder to convince him not to close.<br />
            	Due to lack of transport and other facilities, the late Jonah Kimase used his oxen to ferry water to the school construction.</p>
